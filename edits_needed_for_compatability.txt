power_generation_timeseries_v1.py:

- import func6_cap_fact_timeseries_v0 as cap_fact_timeseries
needs to change to import func6_cap_fact_timeseries_v1 as cap_fact_timeseries

-     ## filename
This line needs to be a bit more descriptive of what file type needs to go in here

- make a requirements.txt file for the user, so its an easy install

pip install atlite
conda install matplotlib
conda install cartopy
pip install pvlib


- In case of problems installing atlite because of rasterio, GDAL needs to be installed on windows, rather, use the conda installation, not the pip, then it works

- put the import geopandas as gpd statement as the last import statement, otherwise crs projection errors, important which module loads first
- may need to do the same for cutout.py in the atlite package for some systems.

- there is unknown user input in func6_cap_fact_timeseries_v1.py
input_file = 'SA_test_1_interpolated_data.nc'
output_directory = 'hourly_output'
